## About the workshop materials:

All of the materials provided in this workshop are adapted from this free online textbook: [https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/]

What we have done is adapt this textbook so that we can learn a lot of the material in a single weekend workshop. This means that we have only picked out the information and exercises that we found the most useful for getting a basic idea of the foundations for geocomputation in R. After this workshop, please refer to this textbook regularly to learn more and solidifiy the concepts we go over during this workshop. We intend on getting you started on mapping in R, but we do not expect you to be fully proficient after completing this workshop.

Please keep us updated on your progress! We would love to see your maps!
